# SoftwareSecurity

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Farms is a company that wants to modernize their operations by creating custom software that is protected from external threats. They wanted Global Rain to provide a vulnerability report and fix their security issues.

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I was able to change the pom file and add an updated dependency report. After that, I was able to change the dependency report to suppress certain vulnerabilities that were not an issue. It is important to code securely because there are new threats every day and many attackers are just looking for the place to steal information. Software security is needed because it protects a company's assets and their confidential information.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The check sum verification was tough because if one part of the code was wrong, the whole check would not run properly on a website.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers by first identifying which security vulnerabilities were present. I was then able to change the code to match those vulnerabilities and check if they were still there. In the future I will use a dependency check to verify what parts of the code are vulnerable.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I was able to test the code afterwards and make sure the dependency check lined up with it. 

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Dependency checks and the Maven site was influential because of its broad information. Not only did the site provide me with the information on my assignments, but it also helped me learn how to do it.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show them my dependency checks and how they are associated with secure coding. It is also important to show that I am aware of the types of threats and how to overcome them.
